# Contributing to {a11ytables}

This outlines how to propose a change to {a11ytables}.

## Fixing typos

* You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
* This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
* You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

* In general, any new features should result in outputs that comply with [the Analysis Function's 'Releasing Statistics in Spreadsheets' guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/).
* If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first [file an issue](https://github.com/co-analysis/a11ytables/issues) and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.
* If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

### Pull request process

* Fork the package and clone onto your computer.
* Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 
* Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). The new branch name should start with your initials, e.g. 'xy-fix-bug'.
* Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header).

### Code style

* New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) for documentation.
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
