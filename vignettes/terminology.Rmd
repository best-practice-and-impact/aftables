# Purpose

This vignette provides a quick lookup of spreadsheet nomenclature, as used in the {a11ytables} package.

# Terminology

Certain language and conventions are used in the package to talk about spreadsheets.

A _workbook_ is a spreadsheet output. It contains _tabs_ that are each named with a unique _tab title_. Each tab contains a _sheet_.

Sheets can be one of four _sheet types_ that dictate their content, layout and style:

1. A _cover_ sheet contains the title of the _workbook_ and information about the data it contains, who has produced it, etc
2. A _contents_ sheet contains a table showing the contents of the _workbook_ at a glance, with one row per _sheet_ (not including the cover or itself)
3. A _notes_ sheet contains a table with a lookup of note codes (e.g. '[note 1]') to their explanations
4. One or more _tables_ sheets contain statistical tables (the main purpose for the existence of the spreadsheet) or annexes of supporting information

The _cover_, _contents_ and _notes_ sheets can be considered _meta sheets_ because they provide contextual information about the _workbook_ and its contents.

_Sheets_ themselves are composed of inserted _elements_ that appear in the following row order (if present):

* a _sheet title_ to be displayed at the top of the sheet (user-provided)
* a _table count_ so users know how many tables are in the sheet (auto-generated)
* a _notes statement_ that declares if a table contains _notes_ (if applicable, auto-generated)
* a _blank cells statement_ that indicates the meaning behind any blank cells in a table (if applicable, user-provided)
* a _source statement_ to explain where the data came from (if applicable, user-provided)
* a _table_ that contains information as rows and columns (user-provided) and has a _table name_ (auto-generated) which appears as the 'name' of the marked-up table
