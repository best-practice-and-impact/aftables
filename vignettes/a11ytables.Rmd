## Purpose

This vignette shows you how to use {a11ytables} to generate a spreadsheet output.

## Workflow

Having installed the {a11ytables} package, there are three steps to generating a spreadsheet:

1. Use `new_a11ytable()` to create a special dataframe object that contains all the information you need in your output
1. Use `create_a11y_wb()` to add styles and a workbook structure
1. Use `openxlsx::saveWorkbook()` to write an xlsx file

The minimal demo below follows these steps, using example data from the built-in mtcars dataset.

You can use the RStudio Addin, which is installed with the package, to insert a pre-filled demo skeleton of this workflow.

### 1. Create an a11ytable

Each argument to `new_a11ytable()` provides information required for each sheet of the spreadsheet.

You provide the majority of information as dataframes passed to the `tables` argument. It's preferable to prepare these first before passing them to `new_a11ytable()`.

Below are some demo tables that we can pass to `new_a11ytable()`. I've used `tibble::tribble()` for human-readable row-by-row dataframe construction, but you can just use `data.frame()`.

```{r tables}
library(tibble)

# Create demo tables of info for supporting sheets

cover_df <-  # required, will be transposed in the final output 
  tribble( 
    ~"Sub title",  ~"Sub body",
    "Description", "Aspects of automobile design and performance.",
    "Properties",  paste0(
                     "Suppressed values are replaced with the value '[c]'.",
                     "\n\n",  # line break into paragraphs
                     "Blank cells in the 'Notes' column indicate the absence of a note."
                   ),
    "Contact",     "The mtcars Team, telephone 0123456789."
  )

contents_df <-  # required
  tribble(
    ~"Sheet name", ~"Sheet title",
    "Notes",       "Notes used in the statistical tables of this workbook",
    "Table 1",     "Car Road Tests (demo)"
  )

notes_df <-  # not required if there's no notes in your tables
  tribble(
    ~"Note number", ~"Note text",
    "[note 1]",     "US gallons.",  # notes should be in the form '[note 1]'
    "[note 2]",     "Retained to enable comparisons with previous analyses."
  )

# Create simple demo stats table

stats_df <- mtcars |>
  head() |>
  rownames_to_column("car") |>
  subset(select = c("car", "cyl", "mpg"))

names(stats_df) <- c(
  "Car",
  "Cylinder count",
  "Miles per gallon [note 1]"  # notes should go in headers, not cells
)

stats_df$Notes <- c(  # add a 'Notes' column to supply row-wise notes
  rep("[note 2]", 2), 
  rep(NA_character_, 4)
)

stats_df[3, 2:3] <- "[c]"  # example of suppressed (confidential) data
```

Now we can construct an a11ytable by passing the required sheet 'elements' as vectors (or a list in the case of `tables`) to the `new_a11ytable()` function.

```{r new-a11ytable}
library(a11ytables)
library(openxlsx)  # was installed with {a11ytables}

my_a11ytable <- new_a11ytable(
  tab_titles = c(
    "Cover",
    "Contents",
    "Notes",
    "Table 1"
  ),
  sheet_types = c(  # 'cover', 'contents', 'notes' or 'tables' only
    "cover",
    "contents",
    "notes",
    "tables"  # stats tables, appendices, etc
  ),
  sheet_titles = c(  # will appear in cell A1 of each sheet
    "The 'mtcars' Demo Datset",
    "Table of contents",
    "Notes",
    "Car Road Tests"
  ),
  sources = c(
    NA_character_,  # use NA where source isn't needed
    NA_character_,
    NA_character_, 
    "Motor Trend (1974)"  # will be inserted above the table
  ),
  tables = list(  # as prepared earlier, note it's a list
    cover_df,
    contents_df,
    notes_df,
    stats_df
  )
)
```

The function will return errors or warnings if anything is missing or seems odd. For example, we're warned that there are empty cells in Table 1, though for this example we've provided on their meaning on the cover sheet.

And here's a preview of the object that was created:

```{r a11ytable-preview}
my_a11ytable
```

You can immediately tell that this is an a11ytable because it's the first word that's printed with the output.

So our a11ytable is basically just a table with one row per sheet and one column per sheet element. In fact, it has class 'data.frame'/'tbl' along with 'a11ytable':

```{r check-class}
class(my_a11ytable)
```

For convenience, you can also check for the a11ytable class with `is_a11ytable()`.

Note that `new_a11ytable()` is the preferred method, but it's also possible to convert a correctly-formatted pre-built data.frame directly to an a11ytable with `as_a11ytable()`. You can try this using the `mtcars_df` data.frame that's provided with {a11ytables}.

### 2. Convert to a workbook

We can use `create_a11y_wb()` to convert our a11ytable to an [{openxlsx}](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/) Workbook-class object. This function inserts into the sheets the information from our a11ytable and applies various mark-up and styles to meet the best practice guidance.

```{r create-a11y-wb}
my_wb <- create_a11y_wb(my_a11ytable)
```

Here's a preview summary of the Workbook object:

```{r wb_preview}
my_wb
```

The output is limited, but you can see an overview of our named sheets and some of the custom styling.

### 3. Write to file

Finally, you can use [the `saveWorkbook()` function from {openxlsx}](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/reference/saveWorkbook.html) to save your workbook object to an xlsx file.

```{r saveworkbook, eval=FALSE}
saveWorkbook(my_wb, "publication.xlsx")
```

You could also open a temporary copy of the workbook with `openXL()`, which is convenient during the development process.

The content of the output spreadsheet will look like this:

<div class="figure">
<img src="../man/figures/vignette-workbook.gif" alt="Gif of a simple Excel workbook created using the a11ytables package, revealing tabs for cover, contents, notes and a table." width="100%"/>
</div>

You'll notice that formatting (e.g. Arial size 12 font for body text) and mark-up (e.g. tables, donated by a marker in the lower-right corner of the lower-right cell of each one) have been applied throughout.

You can apply some final tweaks to this file if the defaults don't quite meet your needs, though it's advisable to keep this to a minimum. At time of writing (v0.0.0.90015) you will need to address two accessibility requirements that are not yet covered by the package:

* apply H1 headers to the sheet titles (which you may need to reformat to Arial 16 bold)
* manually complete the document properties (likely under File > Properties in your spreadsheet software)
* convert text to hyperlinks manually, where required
