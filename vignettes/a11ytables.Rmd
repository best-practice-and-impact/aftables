## Purpose

This vignette shows you how to use {a11ytables} to generate a spreadsheet output.

## Workflow

Having installed the {a11ytables} package, there are three steps to generating a spreadsheet:

1. Use `new_a11ytable()` to create a special dataframe that contains all the information you need
1. Use `create_a11y_wb()` to add styles and a workbook structure
1. Use `openxlsx::saveWorkbook()` to write an xlsx file

The minimal demo below follows these steps, using example data from the built-in mtcars dataset.

### 1. Create an a11ytable

Each argument to `new_a11ytable()` provides information required for each sheet of the spreadsheet.

You provide the majority of information as dataframes passed to the `tables` argument. It's preferable to prepare these first before passing them to `new_a11ytable()`.

Below are some demo tables that we can pass to `new_a11ytable()`. I've used `tibble::tribble()` for human-readable row-by-row dataframe construction, but you can just use `data.frame()`.

```{r tables}
library(tibble)

# Create demo tables of info for supporting sheets

cover_df <-  # required, will be transposed in the final output 
  tribble( 
    ~"Sub title",   ~"Sub body",
    "Description", "Aspects of automobile design and performance.",
    "Format",      "A data frame with 32 observations and 11 variables.",
    "Contact",     "The mtcars Team, telephone 0123456789."
  )

contents_df <-  # required
  tribble(
    ~"Sheet name", ~"Sheet title",
    "Notes",       "Notes used in the statistical tables of this workbook",
    "Table 1",     "Car Road Tests (demo)"
  )

notes_df <-  # not required if there's no notes in your tables
  tribble(
    ~"Note number", ~"Note text",
    "[note 1]",     "Cars are a type of transport.",
    "[note 2]",     "US gallons.",
    "[note 3]",     "Thousand pounds."
  )

# Create simple demo stats table

stats_df <- mtcars |>
  head() |>
  rownames_to_column("car") |>
  subset(select = c("car", "mpg", "wt"))

names(stats_df) <- c(
  "Car [note 1]",  # notes should be in the form '[note 1]'
  "Miles per gallon [note 2]",
  "Weight [note 3]"
)

stats_df[3, 2:3] <- "[c]"  # example suppressed (confidential) data
```

Now we can construct an a11ytable by passing the required sheet 'elements' as vectors (or a list in the case of `tables`) to the `new_a11ytable()` function.

```{r new-a11ytable}
library(a11ytables)
library(openxlsx)

a11y_new <- new_a11ytable(
  tab_titles = c(
    "Cover",
    "Contents",
    "Notes",
    "Table 1"
  ),
  sheet_types = c(  # must be 'cover', 'contents', 'notes' or 'tables'
    "cover",
    "contents",
    "notes",
    "tables"
  ),
  sheet_titles = c(  # will appear in cell A1 of each sheet
    "The 'mtcars' Demo Datset",
    "Table of contents",
    "Notes",
    "Car Road Tests"
  ),
  sources = c(
    NA_character_,  # use NA where source isn't needed
    NA_character_,
    NA_character_, 
    "Motor Trend (1974)"
  ),
  table_names = c(  # make these unique, used by screenreaders
    "cover_sheet",
    "table_of_contents",
    "notes_table",
    "demographic_benchmarks"
  ),
  tables = list(  # as prepared earlier, note it's a list
    cover_df,
    contents_df,
    notes_df,
    stats_df
  )
)
```

And here's a preview of the object that's created:

```{r a11ytable-preview}
a11y_new
```

Basically our a11ytable is just a dataframe with one row per sheet and one column per sheet element.

See [the 'construct an a11ytable' vignette](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/articles/construct.html) for more information on setting up an a11ytable-class object.

### 2. Convert to a workbook

We can use `create_a11y_wb()` to convert our a11ytable to an [{openxlsx}](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/) Workbook-class object, which applies various mark-up and styling to meet the best practice guidance.

```{r create-a11y-wb}
a11y_wb <- create_a11y_wb(a11y_new)
```

Here's a preview summary of the Workbook object:

```{r wb_preview}
a11y_wb
```

You can see we have all our named sheets, each with custom styling.

### 3. Write to file

Finally, you can use the `saveWorkbook()` function from [{openxlsx}](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/) to save your workbook object to an xlsx file.

```{r saveworkbook, eval=FALSE}
saveWorkbook(a11y_wb, "publication.xlsx")
```

And if you open that file you'll see the following:

<div class="figure">
<img src="../man/figures/vignette-workbook.gif" alt="Gif of a simple Excel workbook created using the a11ytables package, revealing tabs for cover, contents, notes and a table." width="100%"/>
</div>

You'll notice that formatting (e.g. Arial size 12 font for body text) and mark-up (e.g. tables, donated by a marker in the lower-right corner of the lower-right cell of each one) have been applied throughout.

You can apply some final tweaks to this file if the defaults don't quite meet your needs, though it's advisable to keep this to a minimum. At time of writing (v0.0.0.90013) you will need to address two accessibility requirements that are not yet covered by the package:

* apply H1 headers to the sheet titles (which you may need to reformat to Arial 16 bold)
* manually complete the document properties (likely under File > Properties in yoru spreadsheet software)
