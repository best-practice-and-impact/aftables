## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Updated the description to put quote marks around 'Python'. (I've followed the R 'reticulate' package in using a capital 'P' for 'Python').
* Added a reference in the description.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

Functions `at_template_aftable` and `at_template_workflow` are for RStudio addins which insert template text at the current cursor position. We have not added examples for these functions as they will not work outside of the RStudio IDE.
