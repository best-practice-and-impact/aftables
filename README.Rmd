## Purpose

An R package to help automatically create reproducible spreadsheets that adhere to the guidance on [releasing statistics in spreadsheets](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/) from the UK government's [Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/), with a focus on accessibility ('a11y').

Visit [the {a11ytables} website](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/) for documentation.

## Accessibility

This package is not yet capable of creating perfectly accessible spreadsheets but will help with the bulk of the work needed. Users of this packages should refer back to [the main spreadsheet guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/) or [the spreadsheet accessibility checklist](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-spreadsheets-accessible-a-brief-checklist-of-the-basics/) after using it to make sure nothing has been missed. Please email [analysis.function@ons.gov.uk](mailto:analysis.function@ons.gov.uk) if you use the package so they can monitor use and the outputs produced.

## Contribute

The package is under (opinionated) active development. Please see [the NEWS file](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/news/index.html) for the latest changes. 

To contribute, please add [an issue](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables/issues) or [a pull request](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables/pulls) after reading [the code of conduct](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributing](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidance. 

## Install

Install the package [from GitHub](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables) using [{remotes}](https://remotes.r-lib.org/).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not already installed

remotes::install_github(
  repo = "best-practice-and-impact/a11ytables",  # GitHub user/repository
  dependencies = TRUE,              # install required/suggested packages
  build_vignettes = TRUE            # generate vignette documentation
)

library(a11ytables)  # attach package
```


## Use

To create a spreadsheet:

1. Use `create_a11ytable()`
1. Pass the output to `generate_workbook()`
1. Pass the output to `openxlsx::saveWorkbook()`

Run `?function_name` or visit [the package website](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/reference/index.html) for function documentation. For long-form documentation, [visit the package website](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/) or run `browseVignettes("a11ytables")` to read the:

* [introductory vignette](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/articles/a11ytables.html) to get started
* [accessbility checklist vignette](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/articles/checklist.html) to see how the package complies with best-practice guidance
* [terminology vignette](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/articles/terminology) to understand the nomenclature of spreadsheet terms as used in this package
* [package structure vignette](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/a11ytables/articles/structure) to see how the package works under the hood

This package also includes [an RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) that inserts pre-filled demo skeletons of the {a11ytables} workflow.

## Related projects

The ONS's Analysis Standards and Pipelines team has released [a Python package called 'gptables'](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/gptables). {a11ytables} is an independent effort that offers a native R solution that is very similar to gptables in its outputs, though there are some differences in implementation.

{a11ytables} can help you fulfil a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) by automating the generation of compliant spreadsheets for publication.
